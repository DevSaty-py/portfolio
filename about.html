            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey there! I’m <strong>Satyam Gupta</strong>, a first-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’m genuinely passionate about this field — it’s exciting to learn how technology can solve problems, make decisions, and improve lives.</p>

            <p>Ever since I started diving into programming and AI concepts, I’ve been fascinated by how much there is to explore. I love experimenting, learning new tools, and connecting with others who share the same curiosity. This portfolio is where I’m sharing my journey, projects, and the skills I’m building along the way.</p>

            <p><em>“The important thing is not to stop questioning.”</em> — Albert Einstein</p>

            <p>That’s exactly what keeps me motivated — staying curious, asking questions, and pushing myself to learn more every day. I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, and new opportunities. So feel free to connect with me — let’s build something amazing together!</p>
